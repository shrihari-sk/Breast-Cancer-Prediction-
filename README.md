 Breast-Cancer-Prediction :- We have use three ML Algorithms in this project 
  1. Logistic Regression 
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Random Forest Classifier 


 outoff which Random Forest Classifier has predicted more accurate followed by Decision Tree predicted 2nd best.
 
 Other than this we have use the concept of Confusion matrix. In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix,[9] is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix)


You will get more idea about it from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix
